This application is like a digital version of putting names in a hat and everybody taking one. But instead of a hat you make a list of names with their email and physical address for delivering gifts.
The program will automatically assign everyone a random secret santa and then email everyone their gift recipient along with the address to send the gifts to. Enjoy and happy holidays! 
ps: dont be a snoop and look at your gmail sent emails folder to see who your secret santa is.

IMPORTANT!!!

in order to login you must use a gmail account and use a 3rd party app password.
to generate a 3rd party app password:

open a google tab> click on top right profile picture > manage your google account > security and privacy > 2 factor authentication > then scroll down till you see 3rd party app passwords.
